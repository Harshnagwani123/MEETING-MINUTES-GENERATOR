    Date: 2025-01-22
    **Sentiment**: Positive (0.03)
    **Summary**:
     There is an indefinable, miscarious power that forbids everything, but I feel it, though I do not see it.  I do feel, as the poor villagers felt about my soul, that there is orderliness in the universe . The safest course is to be lived in the moral government of the world,  the law of truth and love .
