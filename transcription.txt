 I'm so tired
 I'm really young
 I'm so young
 I'm really young
 I'm so young
 I'm so you that I am
 I'm so full
 I'm a fireman from bridge
 I'm an invincible
 And I will never single way
 My eyes are by my bone
 I don't need batteries to play
 I'm so confident
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I don't only alone I will cry
 I'm now
 You'll never single way
 I try in and out
 I don't know deep down
 It is
 I know I've heard that it actually feels yours
 You're on the way
 Don't make fun of your school
 But I'm too afraid now
 It is
 I'm really young
 I'm so you that I am
 I'm really young
 I'm so you that I am
 I'm unstoppable
 I'm a fireman from bridge
 I'm an invincible
 And I will never single way
 My eyes are by my bone
 I don't need batteries to play
 I'm so confident
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm unstoppable but today
 I'm really young
 I'm so you that I am
 I'm really young
 I'm so you that I am
 I'm unstoppable
 I'm a buzzer with no breaks
 I'm invincible
 They have one never single day
 Mine's a powerful
 I don't need batteries to play
 I'm so comfortable today
 Yeah, I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable today
