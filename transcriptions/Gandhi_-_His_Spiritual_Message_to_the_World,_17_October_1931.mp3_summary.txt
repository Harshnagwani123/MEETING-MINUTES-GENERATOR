    Date: 2024-11-21
    
    **Summary**:
     There is an indefinable, miscarious power that forbids everything, but I feel it, though I do not see it

 I do feel, as the poor villagers felt about my soul, that there is orderliness in the universe 

The safest course is to be lived in the moral government of the world,  the law of truth and love .
