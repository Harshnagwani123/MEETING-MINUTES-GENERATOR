 I was mine, I don't know what it takes to fool this star
 I do it till the sun goes down, I don't know what the night is like
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, I tell you what you want to hear
 My sunglasses on my lashette and tears, it's not what the other time
 You're ready
 I feel my own eyes, who you are, so I'm ready
 I feel my own eyes, so I'm ready
 I'm on top of the world, I'm a pleasure in some great
 I'm in a super home, and I will never single day
 My love by my phone, I don't need that only
 It's the play, I'm so happy, yeah, yeah
 I'm on top of the world, I'm a pleasure in some great day
 I'm on top of the world, I'm a pleasure in some great day
 I'm on top of the world, I'm a pleasure in some great day
 I'm on your lower-eye, I'm now, you'll never see what I need
 I know I don't know the half-down, it is
 I know I've heard that the lecture feels yours
 You're on the way, I don't make plans at the school
 But I don't do a break now, it is, it is
 I feel my own eyes, who you are, so I'm ready
 I want my own, I want you that I ain't
 I'm on top of a phone
 I'm a fudge, I'm in one bridge
 I'm in a football
 And I will never see the whole day
 I'm on top of a phone
 I just need batteries to play
 I'm so confident
 Yeah, I'm on top of a birthday
 I'm on top of a birthday
 I'm at my second day
 I'm on top of a birthday
 I'm a earthish, light download
 I'm at's third, light download
 I'm at my third day
 I'm on top of a birthday
 I'm on top of a birthday
 I feel like you're alright, so you are strong, I am
 I feel like I'm alright, so are you dead, I am
 I'm unstoppable, I'm a bunch of in-nombreaks
 I'm invincible, the I've won never single day
 I come in Paris today, I'm stopping in Paris tonight
 I'm unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
 I'm unstoppable, I'm unstoppable today
